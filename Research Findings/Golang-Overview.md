# Golang Overview

Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a programming language developed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically typed language with syntax loosely derived from that of C, adding garbage collection, type safety, some dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types such as variable-length arrays & key-value maps, and a large standard library. The language was announced in November 2009 and is now used in some of Google’s production systems. Go’s “gc” compiler targets the Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Plan 9, DragonFly BSD, Solaris, and Windows operating systems and the i386, Amd64, ARM and IBM POWER processor architectures. A second compiler, gccgo, is a GCC frontend. Android support was added in version 1.4, which has since been ported to also run on iOS.

## Pros

1. **Simple and user-friendly**
If you have any developer experience working with other programming languages, the syntax of Go Lang will be easy and quick to grasp. Go code sometimes looks more readable and elegant even though the code itself is larger.

2. **Defined style rules**
Defined style rules allow easy maintenance of your code and other’s and it restricts any temptation to add your own style to the application.  This can be a bit annoying in the beginning, but the payoff is significant, as soon as you start working on the application with a big team.

3. **Strict compilation system**
If you set a variable and it is not in use or there are libraries that are not used in the code, you will get errors at the compilation stage. It can be annoying, but it also ensures that the code is free of clutter.

4. **Multiple return values**
Not the most useful thing at the development stage, but the availability to draw from the box sometimes is a positive factor for writing  code.
